Above all the area is watershed of the Isiukhu and Yala rivers which flow through the forest before emptying into Lake Victoria. Both forest and reserves make a measure of about 238 square kilometres, a little less than half of which remains as indigenous forest. To its north it rises 45 square kilometres. It is a watery area where glades vary a great deal in structure, some covered with open grass and others with number of trees or shrubs. Therefore, a number of streams and small creeks run through the reserve but the large one are usually bordered by a few to tens of meters of forest on either side which divide the glades whereas the smallest creeks flow through open grasslands thus forming small marshy patches."
